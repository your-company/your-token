(c) all amounts payable to the Company in respect of the Share;

(e) reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Company because an amount referred to in this clause is not paid when due.

### Extent of lien

21. The Company's lien on a Share extends to all dividends and other distributions and other amounts payable to the holder of the Share in respect of the Share, including the proceeds of the sale or other disposal of the Share. The Company may deduct from or set-off against any dividends or other distributions or other amounts subject to the Company's lien any amounts, interest and costs and expenses referred to in clause 20.

(a) exempt a Share in whole or in part from the provisions of clauses 20 and 21; or
(b) waive or compromise payment of all or any part of any amounts, interest and costs and expenses referred to in clause 20.

### Company may forfeit instead of exercising lien

23. If clauses 24 to 26 apply to a Share to which clauses 20 to 22 also apply, the Company may choose which of the lien or forfeiture procedures under this clause it will use. Choosing to use one of the procedures under a clause does not limit the Company's rights to use the other procedures under the other clauses.

### Forfeiture on non-payment of calls

24. Without limiting clauses 20 to 22, unless the Company otherwise determines, any Share on which a call is unpaid (in whole or in part) will, 28 days after the Company gives notice to the Member that the day for its payment has expired, be absolutely forfeited without any resolution of the Directors or other proceeding being required. Subject to the Law, the Company may then cancel or sell or otherwise dispose of the forfeited Share.

### Evidence of forfeiture

25. A written statement declaring that the person making the statement is a Director or Secretary and that a Share has been forfeited on a date stated in the statement, is conclusive evidence of the facts stated in the statement as against all persons claiming to be entitled to or otherwise have an interest in the Share.

### Effect of forfeiture

26. On forfeiture of a Share, the person whose Share is forfeited:
(a) ceases to be a Member in respect of the forfeited Share;
(b) without limiting clause 26(a), loses all entitlements to dividends or other distributions determined or declared or otherwise payable in respect of the forfeited Share and not actually paid; and
(c) remains liable to pay the Company all amounts which, at the date of forfeiture, were payable by them to the Company on, for or in respect of the forfeited Share, including all interest (if any) accrued under clause 40. The Company is under no obligation to enforce payment.

### Sale of Share under lien or sale of forfeited Shares

27. The Company may sell or otherwise dispose of any Share on which the Company has a lien subject to clause 28, or which it has determined shall be forfeited, on any terms and in any manner the Directors determine, provided the sale or other disposal is in accordance with any applicable requirements of the Law.

28. The Company may not sell any Share on which it has a lien unless:
(a) an amount in respect of which the lien exists (Lien Monies) is presently payable; and
(b) the Company has, not less than 28 days before the date of sale, given a written notice to the person registered as the holder of the Share, or entitled to the Share because of the transmission of the Share to them by operation of law, stating that the Lien Monies is presently payable and demanding payment of the Lien Monies in full, and the notice has not been complied with.

### Proceeds of sale
29. The Company must apply the proceeds of the sale or other disposal of a Share under this chapter 5:
(a) first, in payment of all costs and expenses incurred in selling or otherwise disposing of the Share; and
(b) second, in payment of the Lien Monies (in the case of a lien) or, in in payment of the amounts payable on, for or in respect of the forfeited Share by the registered holder of the Share, and unpaid (Outstanding Monies).

30. The Company must pay the balance (if any) to the person registered as the holder of the Share, or entitled to the Share because of the transmission of the Share to them by operation of law, immediately before the Share was sold or otherwise disposed of or as that person directs, subject to that person delivering to the Company the certificate for the Share.

### Effecting the sale or other disposal

31. The Company may do all things necessary or desirable to facilitate and effect the sale or other disposal of a Share pursuant to this chapter 5.

32. The transferee or other recipient of any Share sold or otherwise disposed of under this chapter 5 is not required to see that the proceeds of the sale or other disposal are properly applied as set out in this chapter 5. The transferee or other recipient's title to the Share is unaffected by any irregularity or invalidity in connection with the sale or other disposal or the application of the proceeds of the sale or other disposal.

33. The transferee or other recipient of any Share sold or otherwise disposed of under this chapter 5 is discharged from liability for any amounts called on the Share which were due before the sale or other disposal of the Share, unless otherwise agreed by the transferee or other recipient and the Company.
### No release of liability

34. Where the proceeds of the sale or other disposal of a Share under this chapter 5 (after payment of all costs and expenses incurred in selling or otherwise disposing of the Share) are insufficient to pay the Lien Monies or Outstanding Monies in full, the person or persons liable to pay the Lien Monies or Outstanding Monies remain liable to the Company for the balance of the Lien Monies or Outstanding Monies. Nothing in, or done pursuant to, this chapter 5 releases a person who is or was registered as the holder of any Share, from any liability to the Company in respect of the Lien Monies or Outstanding Monies.

### Remedies
35. The remedy of any person aggrieved by the sale or other disposal of their Shares under this chapter 5 is limited to a right of action in damages against the Company to the exclusion of any other right, remedy or relief against the Company or any other person.

## Chapter 6: Calls

### Company may make calls
36. The Company may:
(a) make calls as the Directors determine on a Member for any or all of the amounts unpaid on Shares held by the Member which are not payable at fixed times under the terms of issue of the Shares;
(b) make a call payable by instalments; and
(c) revoke or postpone a call or extend the time for payment of the call.

### Time of call
37. A call is deemed to have been made when the resolution of the Directors authorising that call is passed or as otherwise specified in the resolution.

### Notice and payment of calls
38. The Company must give written notice of a call on a Member to the Member at least 21 days before the amounts called are due. The notice must specify the time and a reasonable method for payment. The non-receipt of any notice of a call by, or the accidental omission to give notice of a call to, the Member will not invalidate the call.

### Fixed payments deemed calls
39. Any amount which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable on issue or at any fixed date, will for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be a call for that amount duly made, notified and payable on the date on which the amount is payable. In the case of nonpayment, all the provisions of this Constitution relating to non-payment of calls, including payment of interest, costs and expenses, forfeiture and the cancellation or the sale or other disposal of the Member's Shares will apply as if the amount had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

### Interest on amounts not paid
40. Amounts called on a Share and not paid on or before the date for payment bear interest from the date for payment to the time of actual payment at any reasonable rates the Directors may determine. The Company may waive payment of interest, either in whole or in part.

### Payment of calls
41. A Member must pay the amount of each call made on them at the times and by the methods determined by the Directors or the terms of issue of the Shares on which the call is made.

### Prepayment of calls
42. A Member may at any time pay to the Company all or any part of the amount unpaid on the Shares held by the Member beyond the amounts actually called (if any).

(b) include all information required by the Law, including a declaration by the transferor or transferee (or both of them) as to whether as a result of the transfer an overseas corporation or other foreign person (or combination of them) will acquire or cease to have an ownership interest in the company’s shares;
(c) be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and transferee or as otherwise permitted by the Law; and
(d) be accompanied by the certificate (if required by Law and if such certificate has been issued) for the Shares to be transferred and any other evidence the Directors may require to prove the title of the transferor to or their right to transfer the Shares.

### Registration of transfer
44. Subject to clause 45, the Company must register each transfer of Shares which complies with clause 43 and must do so without charge.

### Directors may refuse to register transfer
45. Subject to the Law, the Directors may refuse to register any transfer of Shares if, within 21 days of receipt of the application for transfer and other documents required by this chapter 7, the Board passes a resolution to this effect setting out the reason for refusing the transfer and the Company then sends to the transferee and the transferor notice of this refusal, including the reasons for such refusal, within a further 7 days of passing the resolution.

### Retention and return of transfer document
46. The Company must:
(a) retain all transfer documents for registered transfers of Shares for the period determined by the Directors or otherwise required by law; and
(b) except in the case of fraud or suspected fraud, return on demand any transfer document for a transfer of Shares which the Directors refuse to register to the person who delivered the document.

## Chapter 8: Transmission of Shares

(a) was a joint holder of any Shares, any surviving joint holders are the only persons the Company will recognise as having any title to or interest in those Shares; or
(b) was the sole holder of any Shares, the legal personal representatives of the Member are the only persons the Company will recognise as having any title to or interest in those Shares.

49. Nothing in clause 48 releases the estate of a deceased Member from any liability for any amount unpaid on, or otherwise owing to the Company for or in respect of a Share, whether that Share was held by the deceased solely or jointly with one or more other persons.

## Chapter 9: Alteration of capital

50. The Company may alter its capital in any manner permitted by the Law. Subject to the Law, the Directors may do anything required to give effect to any resolution which alters the Company’s share capital.

### Notice of adjourned general meeting
73. If a general meeting is adjourned for more than 28 days, notice of the adjournment must be given to all Members and those persons who are otherwise entitled under this Constitution or the Law to receive notices of general meetings in the same manner in which notice was, or ought to have been, given of the original meeting.

## Chapter 13: Voting

### Resolution determined by majority
74. At a general meeting all proposed resolutions will be decided by a simple majority of votes except where a greater majority is required by this Constitution or the Law.

### Casting vote of chair
75. If, on a resolution at a general meeting, an equal number of votes occurs on a show of hands or on a poll, the chair of the meeting has a casting vote in addition to any votes to which the chair may be entitled as a Member, proxy, attorney or corporate representative.

### Method of voting
76. Each proposed resolution at a general meeting will be determined by a show of hands unless, before a vote is taken or before or immediately after the declaration of the result of the vote on a show of hands, a poll is demanded as provided by the Law.

### Demand for poll
77. A poll may be demanded on any resolution at a general meeting by:
(a) at least five Members present and entitled to vote on the resolution;
(b) any one or more Members present and holding Shares conferring not less than 10% of the votes that may be cast on the resolution on a poll; or
(c) the chair of the meeting.

### Conducting a poll
78. If a poll is demanded on any resolution at a general meeting, the chair of the meeting:
(a) will decide the manner in which, and the date and time at which, the poll is taken;
(b) must ascertain the number of votes attaching to Shares held or represented by persons voting in favour of the resolution and by those voting against the resolution; and
(c) will determine any dispute about admitting or rejecting a vote and that determination, made in good faith, will be final and binding.

### Votes
79. Subject to this Constitution and the rights or restrictions on voting on any class of Shares:
(a) on a show of hands every Member present has one vote; and
(b) on a poll every Member present has:
    (i) one vote for each fully paid Share held by that Member; and
    (ii) a fraction of a vote for each partly paid Share, equivalent to the proportion which the amount paid is of the total amounts paid and payable for that Share.

80. A person entitled to cast more than one vote on a poll need not use all their votes or cast all the votes they use in the same way.

### Voting by proxy
81. A Member who is entitled to vote on a proposed resolution at a general meeting may appoint a person as that Member's proxy to attend the meeting and vote on that Member's behalf.

82. A proxy may demand or join in demanding a poll.

83. If a Member is present at any general meeting for which the Member has validly appointed a proxy to attend and vote for the Member, the proxy's authority to:
(a) speak for the Member is suspended while the Member is present; and
(b) vote for the Member on any proposed resolution is not suspended while the Member is present but is revoked by the Member voting in person.

84. Subject to the Law, a proxy may vote or abstain from voting on a proposed resolution at a general meeting as they choose. However, if the instrument appointing the proxy directs the way in which the proxy must vote or abstain from voting, then the proxy may only vote or abstain in that way.

### Validity of vote given in accordance with proxy, attorney or representative
85. Unless the Company has received written notice of the matter before the start or resumption of the general meeting at which a person votes as a proxy, attorney or corporate representative of a Member, a vote cast by the person will be valid even if, before the person voted, the Member:
(a) dies;
(b) is mentally incapacitated;
(c) revokes the person's appointment or authority;
(d) revokes the authority under which the person was appointed by a third party; or
(e) transfers the Share for which the appointment or authority was made or given.

### Voting if call unpaid on Shares
86. A Member may not, at any general meeting, vote any Share they hold if any amounts are due and payable to the Company at the time of the meeting on, for or in respect of the Share. This does not restrict the Member from voting any other Shares which they hold, including, subject to clause 79(b)(ii), partly paid shares.

### Voting by joint holders
87. Subject to clause 88, a joint holder of Shares entitled to vote on a proposed resolution at a general meeting may vote all of the Shares in respect of which they are joint holder on that resolution.

88. If more than one joint holder of Shares is present at any general meeting and tenders a vote on a proposed resolution, only the vote of the joint holder whose name appears first on the Register will be counted.

### Voting by transmittee
89. If a person entitled to a Share because of the transmission of the Share to them by operation of law gives the Company, at least 48 hours before the time notified for a general meeting (or a postponed or adjourned meeting), evidence of the entitlement as the Directors may require, that person may exercise the rights in respect of the Share (including voting the Share) at the meeting as if that person were registered as the holder of the Share.

### Ruling on entitlements and votes
90. A person may only object to whether a purported voter is entitled to vote or a vote by any person present and entitled (or claiming to be entitled) to vote should be admitted or rejected, at the meeting at which the purported voter wishes to vote or the vote objected to is given or tendered. The objection must be determined by the chair of the general meeting, whose decision is final and binding. A vote not disallowed as a result is valid and effective for all purposes.

## Chapter 14: Resolutions without meetings

### Where only one Member
91. If the Company has only one Member, the Company may pass a resolution without a general meeting being held if that Member (or their attorney or corporate representative) records the resolution and signs the record.

### Where more than one Member
92.
